My writing and work this semester changed dramatically. I started wanting to write a long movie, but I realized quickly that scripts have limited interest to me. That trying to make movies is a lot harder, then trying to tell a good story. I found the groups very frustrating at times. I don’t think I was the only one who didn’t work hard enough. But also writing scripts is really hard. Sometimes someone has a manic episode and writes in a flurry, mostly though, writing is a lengthy and exhausting process. In my mind I would need 14 weeks to come up with an idea, much less try to finalize a feature. So, I wish that I had done a Tv show or a couple shorts. Or really workshopped even a single short. 
I thought being in the writer’s room and coming up with an idea was really interesting. I found that I am solo writer and that what medium I like to create in constantly changes. Right now it is prose. Often times it is meandering and confusing and pompous. But my voice is still young and I really learned a lot by listening to others iterate. Listening to them think. To realize that they have great ideas and great writing. 
Maybe it’s corny and cliché. But it helped me see that success and attention don’t make a thing more artistically valuable. Just one more people are aware of.

This is honest and insightful. I’d suggest tightening the structure slightly while keeping your voice intact. Here's an edited version that preserves your reflections but makes the flow smoother:

Can you point out obvious typographic errors?

Sure, here are the typographic and clarity-related issues I see:

"then trying to tell a good story" → Should be "than trying to tell a good story" (comparison requires than).
"I don’t think I was the only one who didn’t work hard enough." → This is grammatically correct but slightly awkward. You might clarify whether you mean "I wasn’t the only one who struggled to stay motivated" or something similar.
"Sometimes someone has a manic episode and writes in a flurry, mostly though, writing is a lengthy and exhausting process." → Add a semicolon or period after "flurry" for correct punctuation:
"...writes in a flurry; mostly, though, writing is a lengthy..."
Or split into two sentences.
"In my mind I would need 14 weeks..." → Add a comma after "In my mind" for natural pacing:
"In my mind, I would need 14 weeks..."
"So, I wish that I had done a Tv show or a couple shorts." → "Tv" should be "TV" (capitalized).
"Or really workshopped even a single short." → This is a sentence fragment. Consider combining it with the previous sentence or rephrasing for clarity.
"Listening to them think. To realize that they have great ideas and great writing." → These are sentence fragments; stylistically this can work, but be aware it’s informal. If this is for a formal reflection, you might revise.
"Maybe it’s corny and cliché." → "Cliché" is a noun, so you might say "Maybe it’s corny and a cliché." unless you're using "cliché" adjectivally, which is less standard in formal writing.
Would you like me to polish it fully while keeping the style casual and honest?
